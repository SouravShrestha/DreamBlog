		<br><br>
		<p>We generally dream during four to six cycles per night. Throughout life, that's an average of about 100,000 dreams per person or ten trillion dreams annually worldwide. Dreams have been the topic of many books, and research studies, but until now, there hasn't been a source to allow all dreams to come together to draw a bigger picture.
		<br>
		Gathering all dreams and connecting all the dots is a colossal undertaking and that is exactly what Dreams Cloud aims to do. Dreams Cloud is a dedicated service to dreams and dreamers. All achievements start with a first step and ours is to collect and safe guard dreams.
		<br>
		We continue our efforts to overcome linguistic barriers, expand across devices and platforms, and to increase the depth of our services. We invite you to join us in our journey and help us create a better understanding of our dreams. You can help us by entering and safe-keeping your dreams, allowing others to reflect on your dreams, inviting others to join in, providing us with feedback.
		<br>
		We have taken a great effort to address privacies in our design. Please take a minute to review your setting in the profile section.
		<br>
		You must be 13 years or older to create an account and use DreamsCloud. DreamsCloud is a public platform for social dream sharing.

		We sincerely hope that you enjoy our services.</p>

		<p>Happy Dreams,<br>
